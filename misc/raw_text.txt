<r><p><STRONG><s>**</s>Hello!<e>**</e></STRONG></p>

<p>&#129395; Congratulations with your brand new Ajalan forum! The Free Flarum mission is to help people start independent communities, and we are keen to make yours a success. &#128640; Here are 10 cool things to do with your new forum.</p>

<H3><s>### </s>1. Use your admin powers &#127947;️‍♂️<e> </e></H3>
<p>You have received a mail with your new password. Click <C><s>`</s>login<e>`</e></C> (top-right). Then, click <C><s>`</s>admin<e>`</e></C> and <C><s>`</s>Administration<e>`</e></C>. Here is where you configure the look &amp; feel of your forum, and where you can enable cool features (called "extensions").</p> 

<H3><s>### </s>2. Pimp your forum &#128141;<e> </e></H3>
<p>A standard forum looks boring, right? No worries, there are many ways to style your forum. Start by adding a logo &amp; a favorite icon and change the standard colors. All this is done under the <C><s>`</s>Appearance<e>`</e></C> section in the admin panel. If you are feeling really adventurous, you can add custom CSS/Less to give your forum a bit of eye candy.</p>

<H3><s>### </s>3. Set up your own language &#127462;&#127466;<e> </e></H3>
<p>English is the default language, but many other languages are supported. Go to <C><s>`</s>extensions<e>`</e></C> in the admin panel and search for your language, then enable it. You can also configure Flarum to use this as the default language, if most of your members use that.</p> 

<H3><s>### </s>4. Use your own domain name &#127760;<e> </e></H3>
<p>Free Flarum allows you to use your own domain name. Besides looking look/professional, it helps you if you ever decide to move your forum elsewhere, because you won't be tied to the Free Flarum address. To do this, you should register a domainname elsewhere (for example with <URL url="https://www.namecheap.com"><s>[</s>Namecheap<e>](https://www.namecheap.com)</e></URL>). Then go to <URL url="https://www.freeflarum.com/settings"><s>[</s>Free Flarum Settings<e>](https://www.freeflarum.com/settings)</e></URL> and enter your domain name. Voila!</p>
 
<H3><s>### </s>5. Create an introduction for new members &#128104;‍&#127891;<e> </e></H3>
<p>Create a <EM><s>_</s>Sticky<e>_</e></EM> post, explaining the objective of your forum, the rules to join, etcetera. Don't be a dictator writing pages full of regulation, because nobody likes to join a prison &#128512; You should write something to inspire new members and motivate them to contribute.</p> 

<H3><s>### </s>6. Create interesting posts ✏️<e> </e></H3>
<p>A forum requires interesting content for people to return. Right now, there isn't much here &#128521; So let's change that! Good content is meaningful, useful, entertaining. Write something about your expertise. The news from your sports club. An opinionated essay. Make sure that people think: <EM><s>_</s>I hope s/he will post most like this!<e>_</e></EM>.</p>

<H3><s>### </s>7. Invite people &#128140;</H3>
<p>A forum without users isn't really a forum, is it? So let's invite your friends, colleagues, neighbours over. The first members of your forum should be <STRONG><s>**</s>active contributors<e>**</e></STRONG> as to get the discussions started. So ask the first members to write a few posts with meaningful content.</p> 

<H3><s>### </s>8. Use tags &#128218;️</H3>
<p>Once you have many posts, you can organize them around subjects ("tags"). To do that, first enable the Tag Extension, then go to the Tags section and add a couple of categories. Guidelines: don't make too many tags, especially if you don't have posts for them yet. Tip: create content first, organize later!</p>

<H3><s>### </s>9. Nurture your forum &#127807;</H3>
<p>As they say: <EM><s>_</s>everything that gets positive attention will grow<e>_</e></EM>. So come back often, and add new posts, guide new members and ensure your forum stays a welcome, inspiring place for all your members.</p> 

<H3><s>### </s>10. Remove this post ❌</H3>
<p>Congratulations for making it to number 10. You can now safely remove this post &#128521; Make sure you are logged in as admin, then click <C><s>`</s>delete<e>`</e></C> right underneath this story.</p>

<r><p>This year's Apple Watch Series 7 is likely to have thinner display bezels and use a new lamination technique that brings the display closer to the front cover, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.</p>

<p>![<URL url="https://images.macrumors.com/t/YOv69v87Ds-V0ETH5pT2nyyAgnA=/1600x0/filters:quality%2890%29/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-6s-202009.jpeg">https://images.macrumors.com/t/YOv69v87Ds-V0ETH5pT2nyyAgnA=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-6s-202009.jpeg</URL>](https://)</p>

<p>From the report:</p>

<QUOTE><i>&gt; </i><p>The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is planning to refresh the line this year -- with a model likely dubbed the Apple Watch Series 7 -- by adding a faster processor, improved wireless connectivity and an updated screen, according to people with knowledge of the plans.</p>
<i>&gt; </i>
<i>&gt; </i><p>For this year's model, Apple has tested thinner display borders and a new lamination technique that brings the display closer to the front cover. The new Watch is likely to be slightly thicker overall, but not in a way that's noticeable to the user.</p> </QUOTE>

<p>The model will also include updated ultra-wideband functionality, the same underlying technology in Apple's AirTag item finder, according to Gurman, although additional biometric health sensors are likely to be pushed back to a successor model.</p>

<QUOTE><s>[quote]</s><p>Apple had previously aimed to put a body temperature sensor in this year's model, but that is now more likely to be included in the 2022 update. The blood-sugar sensor, which would help diabetics monitor their glucose levels, is unlikely to be ready for commercial launch for several more years.</p><e>[/quote]</e></QUOTE>

<p>Apple previewed its upcoming watchOS 8 software update at WWDC last week, demonstrating previously unseen features such as the ability for Apple Watch to unlock door and hotel rooms. It was not clear at the time which Apple Watch models these new features would be made for, but Gurman's report suggests they could be exclusive to the forthcoming Series 7.</p>

<p>Gurman previously reported that Apple is working on a more rugged "extreme sports" model of the Apple Watch and that it could launch as soon as this year. However, Gurman has now revised that expectation and says that it won't arrive until 2022 at the earliest. Apple is also said to be planning a revised model of the Apple Watch SE for launch next year, according to the report. Apple launched the latter model in 2020 as a more affordable alternative to the Series 6.</p></r>

<r><p>Apple this week previewed iOS 15, which is available now in beta for developers ahead of a public release later this year. One smaller but useful new feature added is the ability to drag and drop images, text, files, and more across apps on iPhone.</p>

<p>MacStories editor-in-chief Federico Viticci demonstrated the new feature in a tweet:</p>

<QUOTE><i>&gt; </i><p>Using cross-app drag and drop on iPhone in iOS 15. Finally &#127881; #WWDC21 pic.twitter.com/1RbyPBGfcq — Federico Viticci (@viticci) June 7, 2021</p></QUOTE>

<p>Cross-app drag and drop has been available on the iPad since 2017 and Apple has finally extended the feature to the iPhone with iOS 15. Cross-app drag and drop always results in duplication, not movement, of content.<br/>
From the iOS 15 features page on Apple's website:</p>

<QUOTE><i>&gt; </i><p>Drag and drop<br/>
<i>&gt; </i>With support for drag and drop across apps, you can pick up images, documents, and files from one app and drag them into another.</p></QUOTE>

<p>To drag and drop on iOS 15, long press on an image, text, or file and, without lifting that finger, use a second finger to swipe out of the app and open another app. Then, let go of the image, text, or file to drop it into the other app. Long pressing on content makes it appear to rise and adhere to your finger, and as the content is dragged, animations and visual cues identify possible destinations where the content can be dropped.</p></r>

<r><p>Nvidia is putting owners of Kepler GPUs on notice that effective October of this year, there will be no new 'Game Ready' driver updates, only critical security patches as necessary. This means most GeForce GTX 700 and 600 series cards will not benefit from performance optimizations or gain access to new features, or even receive bug fixes once support comes to an end.</p>

<p>"Kepler-based desktop GPUs initially launched in March of 2012. Since then, gaming technology has evolved dramatically with technologies like DirectX 12 Ultimate and Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). Moving forward, Nvidia’s software QA team will be focusing on hardware that supports newer technologies," Nvidia stated in an FAQ on the topic.</p>

<p>The decision affects over two dozen graphics card models. They include:</p>

<LIST><LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX Titan Z </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX Titan Black </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX Titan </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 780 Ti </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 780 </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 770 </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 760 Ti </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 760</LI>

<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GT 740 </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GT 730 </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GT 720 </LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GT 710</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 690</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 680</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 670</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 660 Ti</LI>

<LI><s>- </s>NGeForce GTX 650 Ti</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 650</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GTX 645</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GT 640</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GT 635</LI>
<LI><s>- </s>GeForce GT 630</LI></LIST>

<p>A few GeForce GTX 700 series cards are noticeably absent from the list. Namely, the GeForce GTX 750 Ti, GeForce GTX 750, and GeForce GTX 745 (OEM). Those parts actually utilized a first-generation Maxwell GPU (specifically the GM107), which succeeded Kepler, and will presumably still be eligible for Game Ready driver updates for a bit longer.</p>

<p>YOUR NEXT UPGRADE</p>


<p>(Image credit: Future)<br/>
Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD<br/>
Best graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits<br/>
Best SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the rest</p>

<p>While some may find this disappointing, it does not come as a surprise, for a couple of reasons. For one, Kepler is almost a decade old at this point, so it has had a good long run. And secondly, Nvidia a few weeks ago had updated a data center document to indicate that the R470 driver would be the end of the road for Kepler.</p> 

<p>Curiously, Nvidia later removed the entry, reverting back to listing driver support as "ongoing" for Kepler. This led us to wonder if Nvidia had backtracked, given the current landscape—it's next to impossible to buy a new GPU right now, unless you're willing to pay reseller pricing.</p>

<p>Now we know Nvidia did not change its mind. Instead, the final Game Ready driver for Kepler (R470 GA5) will arrive on August 31, 2021. The first Game Ready driver that doesn't support Kepler (R495 GA1) will be pushed out a few days later, on October 4.</p></r>

<t><p>macOS Monterey makes several improvements to password management, positioning iCloud Keychain as an ideal password service to replace third-party services like Lastpass and 1Password.</p>

<p>In System Preferences, there's a new "Passwords" section that houses all of your ‌iCloud‌ Keychain logins and passwords so they're easier to get to, edit, and manage. There's a similar Passwords section that's been on iOS for some time now, so now there's one streamlined way to access your passwords across Apple devices.</p>

<p>Prior to now, passwords on Mac were accessible through the Preferences interface in Safari, but the System Preferences option is easier to find. As with the prior version of the feature, Safari will suggest passwords automatically and detect compromised passwords for you.</p>

<p>New in Monterey is an option to import and export passwords, so you can move your logins between ‌iCloud‌ Keychain and other password management apps. ‌iCloud‌ Keychain does not have as many entry fields as some password managers, but it supports username, password, and website data.</p>

<p>There's also a built-in authenticator feature, which is coming to iOS and iPadOS 15 too. For sites and apps that use codes for two-factor authentication, you can store those codes right in ‌iCloud‌ Keychain and have them autofilled when you log in.</p>

<p>Direct authenticator support will allow iPhone and Mac users to choose to use Apple's solution over third-party apps and software like Authy and Google Authenticator.</p>

<p>Other smaller changes include an ‌iCloud‌ Passwords extension for autofilling saved ‌iCloud‌ Passwords in the Edge browser, which is handy for Windows users who need cross platform password access in the browser, plus there's a new ‌iCloud‌ Passwords app included with ‌iCloud‌ for Windows.</p>

<p>The ‌macOS Monterey‌ password changes are live now in the developer beta, with Apple planning to release a public beta in July before the software sees a public launch this fall.</p>

<r><p>With tvOS 15, Apple is bringing Spatial Audio to the Apple TV when the set-top box is used with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max. It has been unclear how this feature will work because the ‌Apple TV‌ does not have a U1 chip for head tracking purposes, but Apple recently gave an explanation to Engadget.</p>

<p><IMG alt="apple-tv" src="https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4668/as-images.apple.com/is/apple-tv-4k-hero-select-202104_FMT_WHH?wid=640&amp;hei=600&amp;fmt=jpeg&amp;qlt=80&amp;.v=1617137945000"><s>![</s>apple-tv<e>](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4668/as-images.apple.com/is/apple-tv-4k-hero-select-202104_FMT_WHH?wid=640&amp;hei=600&amp;fmt=jpeg&amp;qlt=80&amp;.v=1617137945000)</e></IMG></p>

<p>When you’re watching a TV show or movie on the ‌Apple TV‌, the head tracking feature (powered by ‌AirPods Pro‌ or Max) detects that you’ve been looking in the same direction, calculates your probable head orientation, and activates the Spatial Audio effect. If you get up, it reactivates.</p>

<QUOTE><s>[quote]</s><p>When you sit down to watch a movie or TV show, the included head tracking feature will lock in after it detects you’ve been looking in the same direction for a while. Once you get up to walk around, it will reactivate.</p><e>[/quote]</e></QUOTE>

<p>Spatial Audio will work with stereo, 5.1, 7.1, and Dolby Atmos content, and connecting the AirPods to an ‌Apple TV‌ that’s running tvOS 15 has been streamlined. When you’re wearing ‌AirPods‌ and are near the ‌Apple TV‌, you’ll see an on-screen popup that will let you connect with a click of the remote.</p>

<p>Spatial Audio is designed to provide a theater-like listening experience with sound that seems to come from all around you. tvOS 15 is also gaining new SharePlay features for watching TV with friends over FaceTime calls and support for pairing two HomePod mini speakers to an ‌Apple TV‌.</p></r>

<t><p>In tvOS 15, Apple has simplified the process of entering a login and password with a connected iPhone by allowing for Face ID and Touch ID to be used for authentication purposes.</p>

<p>Developers will be able to implement a new tvOS feature that enables Face ID or ‌Touch ID‌ integration for authenticating purchases and signing into apps.</p>

<p>You'll see a new "Sign in With Apple Device" option when signing into an app where you need a login for the first time, so long as the developers have implemented this feature.</p>

<p>Users who opt to authenticate with an ‌iPhone‌ or iPad will get a notification on their devices that will bring them to a Face ID/‌Touch ID‌ authentication page that suggests a login credential from the Keychain.</p>

<p>Face ID and ‌Touch ID‌ sign in for Apple TV apps will make the authentication process quicker and more streamlined, with the feature coming this fall in the tvOS 15 update.</p></t>

<r><p>Apple has rolled out a new spatial audio feature for Apple Music subscribers that uses Dolby Atmos to create a richer, more immersive soundstage when listening to songs in the Apple Music catalog.</p>

<p><URL url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-trB7g3ivbQ/maxresdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-trB7g3ivbQ/maxresdefault.jpg</URL></p>

<p>With Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos enabled, the subjective experience is that musical notes are coming from all around you. The steps below show you how to control the new audio feature on any iOS device with an Apple Music subscription.</p>

<LIST type="decimal"><LI><s>1. </s>Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad.</LI>
<LI><s>2. </s>Tap Music.</LI>
<LI><s>3. </s>Under "Audio," tap Dolby Atmos.</LI>
<LI><s>4. </s>Select from Automatic, Always On, and Off.</LI></LIST>

<p>Now that you've enabled Dolby Atmos, you'll be able to enjoy a more immersive audio experience. Apple Music will play Dolby Atmos tracks on all AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip, as will the built-in speakers of the newest iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Just make sure that you have Spatial Audio enabled on capable headphones.</p>

<p>You can check which tracks in Apple Music support the audio effect by looking for the logo in the app interface. Apple plans to add new Dolby Atmos tracks on a regular basis, and will offer up a curated selection of Dolby Atmos playlists. At launch, there are thousands of Dolby Atmos-enabled songs that are available to listen to.</p></r>

<t><p>In iOS 15, Apple has made some welcome improvements to the Photos app, such as the ability to see the EXIF data for a photo. The latter feature is accessed via a new "Info" button, which also brings up a caption field for the selected photo, the location where the photo was taken, and any Look Up information available.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the Info button will also tell you which app on your device that an image was saved from if you didn't take it using your camera. For instance, in the example above, you can see that the HomePod image was saved from the web via Safari.</p>

<p>This metadata information also acts like an organizing tag, so if you tap the "Saved from" location in bold, the ‌Photos‌ app will filter your photo library to show you any other images that were saved from the same app, meaning you don't have to scroll endlessly for any others that might be in your camera roll.</p>

<p>The new feature adds another organizational layer to your photos, allowing you to, say, find all the images you've saved from Messages or WhatsApp conversation threads without having to go into the apps themselves.</p>

<p>‌iOS 15‌ is available as an early developer beta, with a public beta due to be released next month and an official release set to drop this fall.</p></t>

<r><p>In addition to Gmail, Meet, and other Workspace announcements today, Google Docs and Drive will soon get Client-side encryption where “customer data is indecipherable to Google.”</p>

<p>This will allow customers to directly control encryption keys, while end users are still able to “take advantage of Google’s native web-based collaboration, access content on mobile devices, and share encrypted files externally.” This will work with Google Drive files (Office, PDF, and more file formats), Docs, Sheets, and Slides.</p>

<QUOTE><i>&gt; </i><p>Client-side encryption is especially beneficial for organizations that store sensitive or regulated data, like intellectual property, healthcare records, or financial data.

<t><p>One of the headlining changes in the iOS 15 Weather app is the interface. It features an all-new design that changes based on the current conditions in your area. For example, if it’s raining outside or there is rain coming soon, the app will adjust its layout to show the hourly forecast, next-hour precipitation, and the radar at the top.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if there’s no rain in your area, the app focuses on the 10-day forecast and current conditions at the top, and pushes other things such as the radar towards the bottom. This modular design is a really nice touch in the Weather app in iOS 15, and it seems perfect for also coming to the iPad at some point… but that’s not happening this year.</p>

<p>There are also now “thousands of variations” the background design and animations in the Weather app. These show backgrounds and animations are designed to represent the sun position, clouds, and precipitation. Here’s a GIF of it in action.</p>

<p>There’s also a big focus on weather maps with iOS 15. In the built-in Weather app, you can now view maps for precipitation, air quality, and temperature. The maps are full-screen and the precipitation map supports viewing three hours of historical data and one hour of future data in the hourly view, and a week’s worth of data in the day-by-day view.</p>

<p>Another change is support for notifications. Similar to the Dark Sky weather app, which Apple acquired last year, the Weather app can now send you a notification when rain, snow, hail, or sleet is about to start or stop. Apple says this feature is available in the US, UK, and Ireland.</p>

<p>The Weather app in iOS 15 is a really remarkable overhaul, particularly from a design standpoint. The addition of maps and notifications also helps make it a true competitor to third-party weather apps on the App Store.</p></t>

<t><p>Back in September, Google’s internal Area 120 incubator launched Tables as a “user-friendly, intuitive work tracking tool.” The Tables team announced today that the service has proven a “success” and that it will become a “fully-supported Google Cloud product” in the next year.</p>

<p>Last September, we beta launched Tables in Area 120 with the goal of proving market demand for a solution that helps teams organize and track work, and it was a success! Google Cloud has committed to investing in this product area long-term. Moving forward, the beta version of Tables will still be available until we release a fully-supported Google Cloud product – which we expect to complete in the next year.</p>

<p>Google announced the news in an email to existing users today, noting that there is sufficient market demand for the tool.</p>

<p>As a tracker, Tables can be used for: Project &amp; task management, IT Operations, Customer tracker &amp; sales CRM, Employees, teams &amp; recruiting, and Product launch &amp; development. It features automated action Bots, customizable views, Google Chat and Slack integration, and templates that allow for Sheets and .CSV import.</p>

<p>Until the new product is released, the beta version of Tables will remain available for free — there are two per user/month tiers, but Google never charged for the “Paid Plan.” Users will be required to migrate when it launches.</p>

<p>In the near-term, the beta version of Tables will remain as is until we release a fully-supported Google Cloud product, at which time we will require users to migrate. As a reminder, you can always “Export to Sheets” from any workspace or table.</p>

<t><p>The recommendation to stay at home is meaningless to a person who has no home. Same for some other coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation measures, such as frequent handwashing—difficult when even many “public” restrooms are for customers’ use only—and social distancing, which is tricky to maintain on the streets or in homeless shelters.</p>

<p>On top of that, exposure to harsh weather and the inability to maintain good hygiene mean people experiencing homelessness develop skin problems more frequently than people with stable housing. One out of every 5 visits by a person who is homeless to an emergency department or community clinic is due to dermatological conditions, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, Tan spearheaded an effort to collect donations of dandruff shampoos, moisturizing creams, and other over-the-counter remedies for skin problems and assemble them into kits to distribute to Boston’s homeless population. This year, one of the medical students she mentors suggested adding COVID-19–related products, such as hand sanitizer and masks, to the kits.</p>

<p>Tan, recently named a “Patient Care Hero” by the American Academy of Dermatology for helping to create and distribute more than 1000 COVID-19 care kits in Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine, spoke with JAMA about the challenges of treating skin conditions in people experiencing homelessness, especially during the pandemic.</p></t>

<p>A key part of Google’s integrated vision for productivity is routing everything through the Gmail apps. As part of Workspace becoming available “for everyone,” Gmail is getting streamlined navigation on the web, while Google Chat’s “Rooms” will soon be called “Spaces.”</p>

<p>This streamlined navigation, which will be available later this summer, comes as “Gmail” is now home to Google Chat messaging and Meet video calling. Currently, expanding the Gmail navigation drawer reveals Mail (folders &amp; labels), Chat (one-to-one &amp; group conversations), Rooms (larger conversations), and Meet (start or join) sections that you can expand/collapse.</p> 

<p>Web Gmail is moving to a navigation rail (like in Google Photos) with round buttons for Mail, Chat, Spaces (more on that below), and Meet. Once you tap into a view, another drawer appears to the right with familiar navigation. For example, you get the standard list of folders and labels for Gmail and a list of recent conversations for Chat and Spaces.</p>

<p>That said, the top-left corner, underneath the hamburger button, shows an email compose FAB, while avatars of people you’ve just talked to can appear at the bottom. Otherwise, the app bar that features the search field, active status, and other settings, as well as the right rail with add-ons for Calendar, Drive, and more, are unchanged.</p>

<p>Google imagines this as being an easier way to switch between different apps while staying on one page. You can think of it as the bottom bar on Gmail for Android and iOS coming to the web. Meanwhile, the main app you’re interacting with is at the center inside a sheet that features rounded corners at the top.</p>

<p>Google’s key announcement today is how Chat “Rooms” — their Slack and Teams competitor — in Gmail are being rebranded to “Spaces” — a name that might sound familiar. It’s meant to be “a dedicated place for organizing people, topics, and projects in Google Workspace,” if not your “new home,” for work. You can have a chat window — with tabs for Files and Tasks — appear on the left side of your screen while a document takes up the rest of it.</p>

<QUOTE><i>&gt; </i><p>Over the summer, we’ll evolve Rooms to become Spaces and launch a streamlined and flexible user interface that helps teams and individuals stay on top of everything that’s important.</p></QUOTE>

<p>The company sees them as being useful for the times when an email or chat needs to get bigger. It includes features like in-line topic threading, custom emoji/GIFs and other expressive reactions, message pinning, and presence indicators and custom statuses from Calendar while fully integrating with files and Tasks. You can also run polls and integrate workflows with third-party bots.</p>

<t><p>MONTPELIER, Vt. (WCAX) - Vermont has reached its 80% COVID vaccination goal. Gov. Phil Scott made the announcement Monday morning and said, as promised, he is dropping all existing COVID restrictions.</p>

<p>The pandemic milestone means masking, social distancing, distance between tables, Plexiglass barriers and other health measures are now recommended, not required. But municipalities and businesses can place restrictions if they choose to do so.</p>

<p>However, masking will remain in a number of settings like schools, hospitals, prisons and public transportation, to name a few.</p>

<p>The state of emergency will formally end at midnight June 15.</p>

<p>The governor said that as of Monday, 80.2% of the state’s eligible population-- those 12 and over-- have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. And nearly 82% of the population over 18 has been vaccinated.</p>

<p>Vermont is the first state in the nation to reach an 80% vaccination rate.</p>

<p>“Now that we have hit 80%, as promised and effective immediately, I am lifting all remaining state pandemic restrictions and the State of Emergency will formally end at midnight June 15,” Scott, R-Vermont, announced at the news briefing Monday. “And here’s why: Because it’s safe to do so. It is safe because Vermonters have done their part to keep spread of the virus low throughout the pandemic and stepped up to get vaccinated. In fact, no state in the nation is in a better or safer position to do this than we are.”</p>

<p>The governor called the state’s vaccine rollout the most effective in the nation and Vermont is a global leader, saying, “Our state has shown the world what is possible.”</p>

<p>Scott thanked his team and he thanked Vermonters, saying the unity of the people of Vermont is the main reason for our success. He said he is very proud.</p>

<p>Based on the success of the state’s vaccination drive and falling virus counts, the governor last month made the challenge that when the state reached the 80% goal, he would drop restrictions ahead of the original July 4 date outlined in the Vermont Forward reopening plan.</p>

<p>During Monday’s briefing, the governor reflected on the last 15 months, noting it was 464 days ago Vermont recorded its first case of COVID-19. He called COVID a once-in-a-century global crisis.</p>

<p>Scott said even as we hit this milestone, Vermont’s work isn’t done. He says we’ll be ready to rollout vaccines to Vermonters under 12.</p></t>

<t><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged 13 million surplus vaccines to help the world get immunized against COVID-19 as he and other G7 leaders wrapped up a weekend summit in Britain dominated by the pandemic, climate change and China.</p>

<p>Canada previously said it would offer up to 100 million vaccine doses to help poorer countries beat back the global pandemic, but was the only country from the G7 to not say how many of those would be actual shots rather than money.</p>

<p>Trudeau on Sunday said in addition to the 13 million shots it deemed as surplus, Canada paid for the purchase and distribution of 87 million doses through money already sent to the ACT-Accelerator, a global program to make sure the entire world has access to COVID-19 testing, treatments and vaccines.</p>

<p>The prime minister told reporters during a closing news conference that some of the promised jabs are already on their way to countries lagging wealthy nations in the worldwide immunization effort. But he stopped short of saying when the rest would arrive.</p>

<p>"A number of these doses are on their way as we speak, more will come in the coming months," Trudeau said. "We're going to be able to share around the world as we see Canadians getting vaccinated to higher and higher levels, and we simply do not need those doses."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister's Office later provided a breakdown showing more than seven million of the doses being donated are from pharmaceutical firm Novavax, whose vaccine remains in clinical trials and has yet to be approved for use in Canada.</p></t>

<t><p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<t><p>Google is aiming this redesign to be a gradual rollout, so users can expect to see incremental changes in their Gmail experience as the months wear on.</p>

<p>For starters, you’ll see the new iteration of Google’s design language, Material Design. It’s all part of an effort by Google to enforce uniform branding across all of its web properties. Designers should take note — effective design is rooted in clearly communicating to users that they’ll get the same great UX from all products.</p>

<p>As Jeroen Jillissen, Gmail’s UX design lead, points out:</p>

<p>“Gmail is the first G Suite product to roll out with the new version of Material Design, called the Google Material Theme. This new approach helps us to align the look and feel across the company, making it all feel distinctively Google.”</p>


<p>If you’re like many of us, you rely on Gmail as your primary email service, both for work and personal use. In the 14 years since its launch, Gmail has taken a lot of market share from the once-popular Yahoos and Hotmails of the last decade. According to business-stats resource DMR, Gmail’s share of the worldwide email-client market is about 20 percent today. To say that it’s quite popular would be an understatement.</p>

<p>Gmail has now redesigned certain parts of its user interface, with new features cropping up in unexpected places. It’s all part of an ambitious and broad redesign project that Google will roll out in the coming months to its premier email service.</p>

<p>Here’s are some of the user experience (UX) design considerations that went into these new changes.</p>

<p>The biggest design changes and their effects on the UX<br/>

Besides the visual refresh, they have also introduced the following new features:</p>

<p>New density settings that show attachments right in the inbox.<br/>
Snooze.<br/>
Collapsible left navigation and right-side panel.<br/>
Improved security banners.<br/>
Gmail confidential mode.<br/>
AI-powered features like “Smart Compose” and “Smart Reply.”<br/>
The company’s new features seem geared toward making things more convenient and productive for users as they go about their usual tasks within Gmail. For example, collapsible navigation empowers users to only interact with screen elements when they’re actually using them, and Smart Compose intelligently suggests sentence completers while you’re typing.</p></t>

Berger indicated that that was different from the Clinton campaign when they were opponents in the 2016 election, and Sanders agreed.<br/>
"I was tolerated," Sanders replied.</p>

<r><H3><s>### </s>A beloved fantasy farming RPG makes the jump from the Nintendo Switch.</H3>

<p>Rune Factory 4 is almost a decade old, at this point. It first released on the 3DS in 2021, before last year's Rune Factory 4 Special made the jump to the Nintendo Switch. It's also, according to longtime series fans, the best of the bunch—a potent concoction of Harvest Moon-style farming and socializing and action-RPG adventuring. There have been plenty of farming sims on PC in the last few years in the wake of Stardew Valley, but none have so thoroughly blended genres as Rune Factory, which makes today's news that Rune Factory 4 Special is hitting PC a real delight.</p>

<p>In a trailer during the Future Games Show today, publisher XSeed announced Rune Factory 4 Special is headed to Steam (as well as PS4, Xbox One and Series X/S). XSeed also brought a trailer for the upcoming Rune Factory 5, which looks like a huge graphical leap for the series. Makes sense, considering RF4's 3DS origins.</p>

<p>Rune Factory 5, sadly, has only been announced for the Nintendo Switch for early 2022. But if you aim to be a completionist in Rune Factory 4 Special, it may well hold you over until then.</p>

<p>Rune Factory 4 Special releases on Steam this fall.</p></r>

<t><p>With technology at the forefront, the world has been changing faster than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated these shifts, plunging all into a digital-first world, and forcing even the most traditional businesses to transform and adopt digital strategies to remotely extend personalized and humanized experiences and services to their customers.</p>

<p>COVID-19 brought with it a tide of uncertainty and disruption for all businesses. Multiple waves of the pandemic and lockdowns were unpredictable, making it harder for businesses to operate. The most practical solution was to go back to the drawing board to devise a customer strategy for the new normal.<br/>
A customer wants a quick yet uncomplicated experience online -- from browsing products to placing an order, every tap of the process requires attention to detail and personalization by the brand. As consumers continue to raise the bar for experiences they expect in today’s times, it’s becoming table stakes for brands to not only create compelling content but to deliver it to the right customer, at the right time, on the channel of their choice.<br/>
It’s not just the customer that’s online - back-end operations are also remote today, requiring cutting-edge tools that enable collaboration across teams, vendors, and other parties involved.</p></t>

<t><p>During this year's PC Gaming Show, Robot Entertainment confirmed what we've been waiting to hear. Orcs Must Die! 3, currently available exclusively on Google Stadia, will be releasing on Steam this year.</p>

<p>The third in the series remains true to its roots: it's a game of tower defense as third-person action, with two-player online co-op. Orcs, and sometimes ogres, kobolds, trolls, gnolls, and other staple fantasy baddies want your stuff, and to stop them you've got magic weapons and a huge catalogue of traps. In the trailer we see fire, spikes, spring-loaded medieval weaponry, ceiling maces, poison, rolling barrels, arrows, meat tenderizers, hot coals, lasers, wall saws, floor saws, and those things from Indiana Jones and Skyrim dungeons that swing out and impale you (or Lydia).</p>

<p>Unlike previous games in the series, OMD!3 adds War Scenarios that scale up its tower defense to "that cool siege from the second Lord of the Rings movie" grandiosity. To defeat the hordes there's another new addition: Mountable War Machines. These additions, and the story campaign set 20 years after the events of OMD!2, will be available in the Steam version along with "all new content, features, and improvements".</p>

<p>Back in 2011, our review of the original said, "Not since Lemmings has a game so seamlessly mixed engaging mechanics, humor, cuteness, and gleeful cruelty." That certainly seems true of Orcs Must Die! 3, which arrives on Steam this July 23.</p></t>

<r><H3><s>### </s>Our first good look at Avengers' biggest expansion to date, coming August 2021.</H3>

<p><URL url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7W4CG-7MA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7W4CG-7MA</URL></p>

<p>Revealed today during Square Enix's Summer Game Showcase, we now have our first good luck at the Marvel's Avengers Black Panther expansion announced earlier this year: War for Wakanda.</p>

<p>Like the first two heroes added to the game (Kate Bishop and Clint Barton), War for Wakanda will tell an original Black Panther story with characters that both movie and comic fans will recognize. "Black Panther must defend Wakanda from Klaw, who seeks to steal Vibranium for his own desires," reads the brief description below the trailer on YouTube.</p>

<p>Klaw is a longtime Black Panther villain, but if you've only seen the movies like me, you probably only know him as that guy with the beard that's obsessed with Vibranium (portrayed by Andy Serkis).</p>

<p>Despite predictions that Avengers might be shifting to a free-to-play style, it looks like Crystal Dynamics is sticking to its guns with an initial buy-in and free expansions like this one. War For Wakanda is coming sometime in August 2021.</p>

<t><p>Microsoft didn't spend too long on Halo at this year's E3 conference, but it did debut our first look at multiplayer which got me plenty excited. It looks like Halo, classic Halo, but with a bunch of fun new stuff in it, like grappling hooks and new vehicles. Microsoft's Joseph Staten, a longtime Bungie developer who joined 343 Industries late last year to help ship Halo Infinite, also got on stage to talk a little bit about the game—but not to announce a release date.</p>

<p>Infinite's only a few months away, but we still don't know when, exactly, it's coming—Staten only said that singleplayer and multiplayer will launch together "this Holiday."</p>

<p>Microsoft rolled a brief clip of the new Halo ring, showing off a snippet of the environment. Then it cut to a singleplayer cutscene showing a new character—a new AI that looks and sounds an awful lot like Cortana, who went rampant in the last game in the series (that means she's the bad guy now).</p>

<p>Or is she? This scene in Halo Infinite implies Cortana is dead, but it sure sounds like more's going on.</p>

<p>"The rogue AI known as Cortana is gone. She's been deleted," says the new AI. When Chief asks how, he and the new AI realize something fishy's going on. "The mission's changed. They always do," says Chief. This nu-Cortana looks like she'll be our voice-in-our-head companion throughout Infinite.</p></t>
